        “ I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp.
         I’ve been looking to make a transition and have heard some
          people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up for
           the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled 
           shortly thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the  best - and most
            grueling - time of my life. Since completing the course, I’ve 
           successfully 
        switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. ”

        “ Before joining the bootcamp, I’ve never written a line of code. 
        I needed some structure from professionals who can help me learn programming step by step.
         I was encouraged to enroll by a former student of theirs who can only say wonderful things 
         about the program. The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and 
         I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team project, in particular, was outstanding.
          It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial could ever have. In fact, 
          I’ve often referred to it during interviews as an example of my developent experience.
         It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 100% recommend!  ”
